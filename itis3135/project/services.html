            <h4 class="top-edge">Court Reporting</h4>
            <div>
                <p>Our team of court reporters are certified on a state and/or national level and experienced in
                    various types of proceedings. As a court reporter, we are professionally trained to take down
                    verbatim proceedings creating an accurate record of depositions, hearings, meetings,
                    conventions, arbitrations, interviews, conferences, and produce an accurate transcript in a
                    timely manner. Our reporters punctual, versatile to their work environment, and attentive to all
                    the details of the proceeding.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Legal Videography</h4>
            <div>
                <p>We provide a professional and accurate video recording of proceedings. Our video recordings are
                    a great way to supplement any written transcripts. We'll help document your meeting and legal
                    proceeding through our high-tech video and sound equipment. Our videographers will give you more
                    than a fragment of information; they'll give you facial expressions, pauses and documents what
                    was said in your meetings.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Telepehonic</h4>
            <div>
                <p>Conducting a telephonic deposition can be a good way to cut costs and save time travel. Often,
                    deposing witnesses can be located a long-distance away, out of state, or a witness is unable to
                    travel because of physical limitations or illness. This is an issue that many attorneys face.
                    Integrity Court Reporting can save you time and money when parties aren't able to travel. We
                    also guarantee state-of-the-art phone equipment to ensure the best audio possible. Our audio is
                    clear, free of skips and random distortion.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Interpreter</h4>
            <div>
                <p>Integrity Court Reporting, LLC, provides interpretation services in all languages. Our
                    Interpreters are certified and experienced in their respective language(s) and can provide
                    simultaneous verbatim interpretation during legal proceedings. Upon request, we can arrange for
                    an Interpreter to accompany our Court Reporter to ensure clear and effective communication
                    between speakers, resulting in a clean and accurate transcript.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Video/Remote Service</h4>
            <div>
                <p>Throughout the years, video and audio services have become more reliable and dependent upon for
                    litigations, such as depositions, trials, hearings, arbitrations, and mediations. Often,
                    traveling for legal proceedings may not be ideal. Scheduling conflicts, travel costs, long
                    flight times, or weather delays are some issues that can be encountered. Integrity Court
                    Reporting can efficiently connect you and other participants through our secure and high-speed
                    video conferencing services. We also provide mobile and video/text streaming capabilities.</p>
