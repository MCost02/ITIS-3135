        <section class="site-eval">
            <h3>Poorly Designed Site: <a target="blank" href="https://www.lingscars.com">Ling's Cars</a></h3>
            <p><b>This seems to be a website for an auto dealer. The website is very cluttered and hard to navigate.</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> The contrast on this site is awful. The floral background, the bright extremely
                    bright colors, and the animations make it painful on the eyes and frankly, very ugly. </li>
                <li><b>Repitition:</b> As far as repetition, the only thing that seemed consistent is the vehicle
                    manufacturers on the left side of the page with specific listings in the middle. However, it is
                    still very hard to follow and the rest of the page doesn't seem to follow any sort of pattern.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> Although the alignment on this site isn't the most appealing, it is consistent
                    throughout the various sections. However, since all the vehicle makes and models are
                    left-aligned, there is a lot of blank space in the middle and right side as you scroll further
                    down the page.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity:</b> Everything is in close proximity to each other and in sections, but it is still an
                    eyesore. While the middle section with specific vehicle listings is grouped nicely in a grid, the
                    vehicle manufacturer column on the left needs some work. This would be better suited with a
                    scrollable section or collapsible menu rather than scrolling down the entire page.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="site-eval">
            <h3>Well Designed Site: <a target="blank" href="https://www.genesisblockchain.io">Genesis Block</a></h3>
            <p><b> This appears to be a website for blockchain technology. It has a simple, yet elegant design that is very
                appealing to the eye.</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> The contrast on this site is quite nice, consisting of white text on a black
                    background, with occasional accents of blue, green, and purple. Everything is easy to read and
                    it is easy on the eyes.</li>
                <li><b>Repitition:</b> The repetition on this site is great, with consistent use of the same font,
                    sizes, and colors throughout the entire website.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> The site uses left-aligned text, with visual elements and spacing in between. This
                    creates an easy to read, visually appealing website.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity:</b> Related content is nicely grouped together with great use of space between
                    different sections. The scrolling animation is an excellent touch as you transition through
                    different blocks of text. </li>
            </ul>
